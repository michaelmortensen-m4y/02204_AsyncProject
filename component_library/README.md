# Folder Overview

This folder contains the source code for the basic components used for the project.

* ctrl: VHDL source for the click controller and its testbench.
* delay: VHDL source code for the delay element.
* fork: VHDL source code for a click fork component.
* join: VHDL source code for a click join component.
* memory: VHDL source code for BRAM.
* rings: VHDL source code for a number of different ring configurations used for verifying the functionality of the controller, fork and join components.
